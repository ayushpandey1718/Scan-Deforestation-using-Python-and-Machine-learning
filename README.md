This project aims to detect deforestation using satellite images and machine learning techniques.


## Usage

- Run the `model.py` script to train and evaluate the machine learning model.
- View the segmented images in the generated plots.

## Features

- Utilizes satellite images and machine learning to detect deforestation.
- Preprocesses satellite data and extracts features for model training.
- Evaluates the model for accuracy in identifying deforestation areas.
- Contributes to environmental conservation efforts by analyzing land cover changes.
- Provides insights into deforestation patterns through accuracy metrics and visualizations.
